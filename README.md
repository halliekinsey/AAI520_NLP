## ReelTalk: A Cinematic NLP Chatbot  

### Repository Overview

This repository contains a conversational AI project that leverages the GPT-2 model for generating human-like dialogue responses based on the Cornell Movie Dialogues dataset. 
The objective is to fine-tune the GPT-2 model to improve its conversational abilities through extensive training on movie dialogues.

### Dataset

The Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus is a rich dataset consisting of a diverse collection of movie scripts, capturing the interactions between characters in various films. 
It includes over 220,000 conversational exchanges from more than 600 movies, providing valuable insights into character dynamics and dialogue structure (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil & Lee, 2011). 
The dataset is particularly beneficial for training dialogue systems due to its representation of natural language conversations and its variety in genres and character types.

### Project Summary 

This project aims to enhance the conversational capabilities of the GPT-2 model by fine-tuning it on the Cornell Movie Dialogues dataset. 
Through a series of training iterations, the model is designed to learn patterns in dialogue structure, enabling it to generate contextually relevant and coherent responses in a conversational format. 
Despite challenges encountered during training, such as balancing resource consumption and achieving optimal performance, the project seeks to demonstrate the potential of GPT-2 in generating engaging and realistic dialogues, suitable for various applications in conversational AI (Radford et al., 2019; Yao & Bansal, 2020).
